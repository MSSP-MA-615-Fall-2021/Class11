## Joins
  - inner_join retains only the records that match both data1 & data2 
  - left_join retains all the records from data1 and returns NA if there is not match in data2
  - right_join retains all the records from data2 and returns NA if there is not match in data1
  - full_join retians all the records from both data1 and data2 and returns NA where there are no matches
  - semi_join retains the rows in data1 that have a match in data2
  - anti_join retains only the rows in data1 that DO NOT have match in data2
